As the new president Donald Trump's just gave his new inaugural speech, in this project, we are going to looking at all inaugural speeches given by presidents. 

Before we are doing any further analysis, we load relative packages and our text file into R.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
packages.used=c("rvest", "tibble", "qdap", 
                "sentimentr", "gplots", "dplyr",
                "tm", "syuzhet", "factoextra", 
                "beeswarm", "scales", "RColorBrewer",
                "RANN", "tm", "topicmodels")

# check packages that need to be installed.
packages.needed=setdiff(packages.used, 
                        intersect(installed.packages()[,1], 
                                  packages.used))
# install additional packages
if(length(packages.needed)>0){
  install.packages(packages.needed, dependencies = TRUE)
}

# load packages
library("rvest")
library("tibble")
library("qdap")
library("sentimentr")
library("gplots")
library("dplyr")
library("tm")
library("syuzhet")
library("factoextra")
library("beeswarm")
library("scales")
library("RColorBrewer")
library("RANN")
library("tm")
library("topicmodels")

source("../lib/plotstacked.R")
source("../lib/speechFuncs.R")
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
### Inauguaral speeches
main.page <- read_html(x = "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/inaugurals.php")
# Get link URLs
# f.speechlinks is a function for extracting links from the list of speeches. 
inaug=f.speechlinks(main.page)
#head(inaug)
as.Date(inaug[,1], format="%B %e, %Y")
inaug=inaug[-nrow(inaug),] # remove the last line, irrelevant due to error.

#### Nomination speeches
main.page=read_html("http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/nomination.php")
# Get link URLs
nomin <- f.speechlinks(main.page)
#head(nomin)
#
#### Farewell speeches
main.page=read_html("http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/farewell_addresses.php")
# Get link URLs
farewell <- f.speechlinks(main.page)

inaug.list=read.csv("../data/inauglist.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

As we all know, Republican and Democratic are the two biggest parties in the America. So our focus is going to be at these parties. Before jump into the conclusion stated directly, we can use some graph and numerical tool to confirm this statement.  

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
speech.list$Party<-as.factor(speech.list$Party)
speech.list$Win<-as.factor(speech.list$Win)
levels(speech.list$Win)[1]<-"No"
levels(speech.list$Win)[2]<-"Yes"
ggplot(aes(x=Win,fill=Party),data=speech.list)+geom_bar(position="fill")+scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")+xlab("Winning Presidency")+ylab("Percent")+coord_flip()+theme_bw()+ggtitle("Figure1: Propotion of Winning Presidency")+theme(plot.title=element_text(lineheight=.8))
table(as.factor(inaug.list$Party))/length(inaug.list$Party)
```

From this Mosaic plot, we can see those presidents who won presidency, most of them are from Republican Party. This idea is also supported by the table summary above. So from now on, our analysis can only be about Republican and Democratic. 


2. Over the time, do Repbulican and Democratic focus on different aspects?

In order to approach this question, we need to extract the most common useful words in the text and get rid of punctuations. Notice that the phrase "useful words" means words that contains useful meaning in a inaugural speech, and should not be those words who are like "people", "we", or "will", etc. Based on this, our first task should be removing this kind of words.   

```{r}
#Create a function that removes punctuation in the inaugural speech:
removepunc <- function(text.file){
  text.file.re<-tm_map(text.file, removePunctuation)
  return(text.file.re)
}
AL1<-read.t("inaugAbrahamLincoln-1.txt")
removepunc(inaugAbrahamLincoln-1)
```


```{r}

```


```{r}

```
