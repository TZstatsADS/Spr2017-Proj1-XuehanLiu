This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Difference in Presidents' Inaugural Speeches between Repubilican Party and Democratic Party 
+ This project is conducted by [Xuehan Liu]

+ Project summary: Through the analysis on presidents' inaugural speeches, we see there exist some differences between two major political parties in US, Repubilican and Democratic. the Repubilican tends to be more liberal and broad-minded while the Democratic is more conservative. The philosophy of each party is embraced well in presidents' inaugural speeches.
